# Canvas-GPA-Calculator
Chrome Extension that calculates GPA on Canvas when blocked by a teacher because I couldn't find a good workaround online.

## Installation Guide
1. Download files and unzip
2. In your browser, go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser
3. Enable dev mode, then select the button labeled "Load unpacked"
4. Select the unzipped file directory and then run in any `instructure.com` subdomain, must be the grades section of an individual course
   - For example: `https://school.instructure.com/courses/1334/grades`
